        <h1>Lab 4 Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this lab was to create a Pseudocoding and Problem-solving.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>For this lab we are to get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding . It was a little difficult to code the Java script because we didn't have experience. But after doing some research we were able to make it work. <p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>This is the jaba scrip code we were able to make it work with some research and help from other colleges <p>

        <p> This is the file I created.This is the java script:</p>
